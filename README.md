The Iris flower dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.
It consists of measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. 
The features measured for each flower include:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)

Steps to Perform Random Forest Classification on the Iris Dataset:

1)Load the Iris Dataset:The dataset is available in the sklearn.datasets module.
2)Preprocess the Data:Convert the features and labels into a format suitable for training a model.
3)Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
4)Train a Random Forest Classifier: A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple 
decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
5)Random forests handle overfitting well, making them suitable for datasets like the Iris dataset.
6)Evaluate the Model:Evaluate the trained Random Forest model using accuracy, confusion matrix, or cross-validation to understand how well the model is performing.
